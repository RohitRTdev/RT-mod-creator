----rtmodx64----
USAGE: rtmodx64 [<OPTIONS>] <FILE(s)> [-o <OUTPUT-FILE>]
If -o option is not given then a .rm file with same filename as input file will be generated...
OPTIONS:
-v or --version: Display version information
-h or --help: Display this help menu
-o or --output: Give the output file name(Provided there is only one input file)

NOTES: rtmod does support redirections, which means you can do this:
somecommand someinput | rtmodx64

However, make sure that the piped output is in proper format, and care must be taken so as to not add any trailing or leading whitespaces.
Ex: echo --help | ./rtmodx64  -> This is fine
    echo " --help" | ./rtmodx64 -> This is not fine(as it has leading whitespace)
